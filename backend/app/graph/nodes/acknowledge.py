"""
Acknowledge Node — the first thing that happens after a webhook is received.

Responsibilities (per assignment spec):
1. Save the inbound message to the DB with status=PENDING_RESPONSE.
2. Send the read receipt.
3. Turn the typing indicator ON and start the heartbeat that keeps it alive
   for the duration of LLM reasoning (WhatsApp's typing indicator expires
   after ~25s, so a single fire-and-forget call isn't enough).

This node must be fast and must not raise — it's on the critical path that
determines how quickly the customer sees the typing indicator, which is
the whole point of the UX requirement.
