"""
In-process asyncio task registry.

Used for two things that need explicit lifecycle control:
1. The typing indicator heartbeat (started in Acknowledge, must be
   cancelled the instant Dispatcher/Handover sends the real reply).
2. The top-level LangGraph execution task spawned by the webhook handler
   (tracked so we can log/observe if one fails, rather than it vanishing
   as an unawaited task exception).

This is intentionally simple (a dict keyed by an arbitrary string key) —
see the architecture discussion for why we chose in-process asyncio over a
durable queue like Redis/Arq for this project's scope.
